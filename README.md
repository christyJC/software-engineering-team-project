# Team Wumbo

## Project description:
### Summary
This project is a small game made in Godot for CIS350. It is written in GDScipt. The goal is to get to the tree at the end of each stage to progess to the next level. To provide some challenge, there are blobs that damage the player if they touch them from the side. The player has a gun to fight the blobs. Additionally, there are apples to collect as a form of 'score'.

### Features
* 2D sidescoller/platformer
* 3 levels
