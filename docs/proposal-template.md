# Introduction

The goal for this project is to create a fairly simple video game. 
To help aid in development, the game engine Godot will be used. The 
language that the game will be written in is GDScript, which is a 
python-like language made for Godot.

For the design of the game, we are interested in making a side-scrolling 
platformer/shooter. Games that we are inspired by include Megaman, Metroid,
and Contra. The player will be able to run around, jump, and pick up
power-ups/weapons. Having multiple levels, enemies, hazards, and a boss
at the end are some of our goals.


# Anticipated Technologies

* Godot - Game Engine
* GIMP - Character and level art
* Royalty free assets from itch.io
 
# Method/Approach
 
Basic versions of features will be created and tested together.
Once the simple aspects work, ideas will be revisted and more 
complexity will be added.
 
# Estimated Timeline
### Basic working demo
* Very basic level design
* Player movement
* Simple enemy

### Player, Enemy, and Level details

* Different enemy types
* 1 level with more detailed design

### User interface
* HUD for HP, XP, etc.
* Start Menu
* Pause Menu

### Player and Characters completed

* Level art
* FX/parctiles
* Music

# Anticipated Problems

* Learning the Godot language - GDScript
* Inexperience with game development
* Difficulty coordinating tasks
* Varying availability
